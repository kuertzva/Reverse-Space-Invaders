# Reverse-Space-Invaders
Space Invaders, but you are the invader.

This is a project on a reimagining of space invaders but with changes. As of now, there is no associated code. This is an 
explanation of the 

In Space Invaders, you control the ship at the bottom and fire at the aliens.

In this iteration, you will play the aliens fighting against the ship. Firing by the aliens will be bound with the number keys.
There will be 10 columns of aliens and when the relevant key is press, the bottom most alien in the column will fire. No two aliens 
can fire in the same two second period (may be changed). This prevents the player from spamming.

The ship will have an ai where it will dodge a random amount of time after each shot occurs. This wil be implemented so that he almost
always dodges in time. The trick will be to corner the ship by making it dodge into a trap. Offensive ai is not yet determined. 

The shields may or may not be breakable as in the original.

You will also have control of the saucer that flys back and forth in the background. It can fire as much as it wants. left and right 
will move the saucer, down will fire.
